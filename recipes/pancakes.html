    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour, see tips below for how to measure flour</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon aluminum-free baking powder, see notes for substituting baking soda</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon of fine sea or table salt or 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

            <li>1 ¼ cups (295 ml) milk, dairy or non-dairy</li>

            <li>1 large egg</li>

            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for skillet</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and the salt in a medium bowl.</li>

            <li>Warm milk in the microwave or on top of the stove until lukewarm, not hot. You should be able to keep your finger submerged for 10 seconds.</li>

            <li>Whisk milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until combined. (By warming the milk slightly, the melted butter mixes into the milk instead of turning into small lumps).</li>

            <li>Heat a large skillet (or use griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when you splatter a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the pan and eventually evaporates.

            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour milk mixture into the well and use a fork to stir until you no longer see clumps of flour. It is okay if the batter has small lumps – it is important not to over-mix the batter.</li>

            <li>Lightly brush skillet with melted butter (this is optional if you have a high-quality non-stick pan). Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto the skillet. Gently spread the batter into a 4-inch circle.</li>

            <li>When edges look dry, and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces of the pancake, turn over. This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and berries.</li>
        </ol>
